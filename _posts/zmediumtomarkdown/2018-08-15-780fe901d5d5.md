### What is the most important abstract concept in the world?

**TL;DR — I believe [Data \(computing\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_%28computing%29){:target="_blank"} \.**

Wikipedia says “ [**_Abstraction_**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction){:target="_blank"} _in its main sense is a conceptual process by which general rules and concepts are derived from the usage and classification of specific examples\._ ” So one could argue that the most abstract thing is where the process of **abstraction converges** to a single point for any \(specific\) example; this unique point I believe is data\.

In particular, I feel that everything could be encoded as data e\.g\. \(from the Wikipedia example [https://en\.wikipedia\.org/wiki/Ab\. \. \.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction#Simplification_and_ordering){:target="_blank"} \)


> _\(0\) Data \(to observe this step, note that the publication was most likely written on a computer, or could easily be inputted into a computer — which represents everything as binary data\)_ 
 

> _\(1\) a publication_ 
 

> _\(2\) a newspaper_ 
 

> _\(3\) The San Francisco Chronicle_ 
 

> _\(4\) the May 18 edition of the The San Francisco Chronicle_ 
 

> _\(5\) my copy of the May 18 edition of the The San Francisco Chronicle_ 
 

> _\(6\) my copy of the May 18 edition of the The San Francisco Chronicle as it was when I first picked it up \(as contrasted with my copy as it was a few days later: in my fireplace, burning\)_ 




Other things that we have converted to binary data for manipulating via a computer with include: sound waves, the rules of the universe for simulating the Big Bang, and in some sense the building blocks of life is DNA=data, also\.

Thus, can data explain everything? I believe is can \(perhaps we are just living inside [The Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix#Philosophical_influences){:target="_blank"} , and “Our external physical reality is a mathematical universe \(https://en\.wikipedia\.org/wiki/Mathematical\_universe\_hypothesis\)”\) \. But I think the really important question is how do we efficiently encode things as data \(e\.g\. a human brain\) for easy manipulation on a computer?
