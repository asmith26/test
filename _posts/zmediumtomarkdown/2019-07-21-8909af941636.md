### A few notes from Andrew Ng’s “AI For Everyone”

[https://www\.coursera\.org/learn/ai\-for\-everyone](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ai-for-everyone){:target="_blank"}
### AI Strategy
- Strategic data acquisition
- Unified data warehouse
- New roles \(e\.g\. Machine Learning Engineer\)

### ML tends to work well when:
- Learning a “simple” concept
- Lot of data available
- Think about automating tasks rather than automating jobs\. \(What are the main drivers of business value? What are the main pain points in your business?\)

### Key steps of a Machine Learning project:
1. Collect data
2. Train model \(iterate many times until good enough\)
3. Deploy model \(get data back; maintain/update model\)

### Key steps of a Data Science project:
1. Collect data
2. Analyse data \(iterate many times to get good insights\)
3. Suggest hypotheses/actions \(deploy changes; re\-analyze new data periodically\)
