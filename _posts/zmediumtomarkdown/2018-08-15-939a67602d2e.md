### What are the odds for the horse race card game?

My father challenged me to the following problem — what are the odds for each “horse” in the following game scenario:

**1\.** The 4 aces \(“horses”\) are laid face\-up at 1 end of the table\.

**2\.** 6 cards face\-up are laid \(“race track”\) in a straight line perpendicular to the aces\.

**3\.** The race proceeds by flipping the remaining deck, & the ace matching that suit advances 1 step until a winner reaches the finish line \(card 6\) \.

\[ **TL;DL** the probability of each horse winning is essentially governed by a [multinomial distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_distribution){:target="_blank"} , however we must take into consideration that the probabilities of flipped cards change \(since the probability of future flips depends on what has already been flipped\) \. \]

_\[Unfortunately Medium does not support LaTex/mathemetics yet, so some parts below may be difficult to read\. \]_

Here is a solution that describes:
1. Firstly how to calculate the number of sequences that are possible from each \(winning\) combination of cards\.
2. Using these counts for the number of sequences, we compute the probability of observing such a combination of cards based on the remaining cards in the \(unflipped\) deck\.
3. Finally we sum these individual probabilities of each combination to establish the overall probability each horse winning, before converting them into betting odds\.


**Initial Remarks:**
- The more cards of a particular suit showing on the track, the less likely that suit will be flipped within the remaining deck and so the less likely that suit will win \(i\.e\. higher odds\. \)
- There are 52\- \(4\\mbox\{ aces\} \+6\\mbox\{ racetrack cards\} \)=42 cards remaining in the pack\.


**Step1: Calculating the number of sequences that are possible from each \(winning\) combination of cards\.**

First consider the case for the heart horse to win\. Let the sequence of flipped cards be denoted by H:=\\mbox\{“Heart card”\}, C:=\\mbox\{“Club card”\}, D:=\\mbox\{“Diamond card”\} and S:=\\mbox\{“Spade card”\} \.

For hearts to win, we require a combination of 6H’s with at most 5C’s, 5D’s and 5S’s to occur\. Each such combination can arise from various sequences of flipped cards\.

We can count how many sequences arise from a particular combination of cards in the following way; **note the last card of the sequence MUST always be a H for the heart horse to win** \(as the game finishes when we have a winner\), thus in our dicussion of sequences below we omit this 6th H and only refer to the 5 other flipped H’s \(e\.g\. the first sequence, 5H’s, refer to winning sequence \{HHHHH\} \+ \{H\} \)
1. **5H’s** \(and no C’s, D’s or S’s flipped\), i\.e\. \{HHHHH\} \. Note there is only **1 way** for this combination of cards \(in particular the order of the H’s do not matter as each H has the same effect of advancing the heart horse by one step\) \. 
Although we can simply count the number of possible sequences for this particular combination of cards, as the combinations of cards increases and becomes more complicated, we can use the following equation to calculate this:
2. \{n\\choose r\}:=\\frac\{n\! \} \{r\! \(n\-r\) \! \}= _”The number of ways for positioning_ r _cards within a total of_ n _cards \(where order doesn’t matter\)”_
3. Indeed, for the combination of 5Hs, the number of ways for positioning the r=5 **H cards** within the total of n=5 cards \(which in this case are just the same 5H’s\) is \{5\\choose 5\}=\\frac\{5\! \} \{5\! \(5–5\) \! \}= **1 way** \.
4. **1S, 5H’s** , i\.e\. \{SHHHHH, HSHHHH, HHSHHH, HHHSHH, HHHHSH, HHHHHS\}= **6 ways** \. Again, we can confirm this using the equation above; note here we must also consider the positioning of the 1S:

- The number of ways for positioning the r=5 **H cards** within the total of n=6 cards \(i\.e\. the 5H’s and the 1S\) is \{6\\choose 5\}=\\frac\{6\! \} \{5\! \(6–5\) \! \}= **_6_ ways** \.
- The number of ways for positioning the r=1 **S card** within the **remaining** n=1 card is \{1\\choose 1\}= 1 **way** \.
- Note n=1 now as we have fixed 5 positions for the 5H’s, and so there is only one remaining spot available for the 1S which it is **forced** to be positioned at\.
\(E\.g\. if we fix the positions for the 5H’s to be the **first 5 places** , \{ **HHHHH** \_ \}, then the 1S is **forced** **to the** **6th position** , \{HHHHH **S** \} \)
- Thus, overall there are 6\\times 1= **6 ways** for positioning the 5H’s and 1S\.

1. **2S’s, 5H’s** , i\.e\. \{SSHHHHH, SHSHHHH, SHHSHHH, …, HHHHHSS\} = \{7\\choose 5\} \\times\{2\\choose 2\}=21\\times 1= **21 ways** following the same logic as above\.
2. …
3. **5S’s, 5H’s** , i\.e\. \{SSSSSHHHHH, SSSSHSHHHH, SSSHHSSHHH, …, HHHHHSSSSS\}=\{10\\choose 5\} \\times\{5\\choose 5\}=252\\times 1= **252ways** \.
4. **1C, 1S, 5H’s** , i\.e\. \{CSHHHHH, CHSHHHH, CHHSHHH, CHHHSHH, CHHHHSH, CHHHHHS, SCHHHHH, …, HHHHHSC\}= \{7\\choose 5\} \\times\{2\\choose 1\} \\times\{1\\choose 1\}=21\\times 2\\times 1= **42 ways** \.
5. …
6. **5S’s, 5D’s, 5C’s, 5H’s** , which has \{20\\choose 5\} \\times\{15\\choose 5\} \\times\{10\\choose 5\} \\times\{5\\choose 5\} possible sequences\.


Recall, we stop at this combination of cards since if we have more than 6 cards for any suit other than H, the race would have already ended with a \(non\-heart\) winner\.

Following this logic, we see that the number of sequences given **any** combination of cards can be computed as follows \(let n\_H, n\_C, n\_D, n\_S **denote the _number_ of flipped H,C,D,S** respectively\):
- Thre are \{n\_H\+n\_C\+n\_D\+n\_S\\choose n\_H\} possible positions for the n\_H Heart cards\.
- Then once the n\_H H’s have been positioned, there remains \{n\_C\+n\_D\+n\_S\\choose n\_C\} possible positions for the n\_C C’s\.
- Likewise \{n\_D\+n\_S\\choose n\_D\} and \{n\_S\\choose n\_S\} possible positions for the remaining n\_D D’s and n\_S S’s respectively\.
- Consequently, the number of sequences for a combination of n\_H H’s, n\_C C’s, n\_D D’s, n\_S S’s is:
- \{n\_H\+n\_C\+n\_D\+n\_S\\choose n\_H\} \\times\{n\_C\+n\_D\+n\_S\\choose n\_C\} \\times\{n\_D\+n\_S\\choose n\_D\} \\times\{n\_S\\choose n\_S\}


\[We can simplify this further by expanding the equations and cancelling common terms in the numerator and denominator \(an exercise left for the reader\), to obtain \\frac\{ \(n\_H\+n\_C\+n\_D\+n\_S\) \! \} \{n\_H\!n\_C\!n\_D\!n\_S\! \} \]

**Step2: Using these counts for the number of sequences, we compute the probability of observing such a combination of cards\.**

Let:
- r\_H denote the number of remaining H cards\.
- n\_H denote the number of flipped H \(as before\)


and recall initially there are 42 cards remaining in the pack, then for e\.g\. the combination of 6H’s \(note we **include the 6th H** in the probability calculations as they **do depend** on how likely this last H is flipped\):

\\begin\{eqnarray\* \} \\mbox\{prob\( \\ \{HHHHHH\\ \} \) \} & = & \\mbox\{prob\(“Observing a combination of 6H’s \(any order\)”\) \} \\times\\mbox\{ \(the number of possible sequences 6H’s\) \} \\ \\ & = & \\frac\{r\_ \{H\} \} \{42\} \\times\\frac\{r\_ \{H\} \-1\} \{42–1\} \\times\\frac\{r\_ \{H\} \-1–1\} \{42–1–1\} \\times\\frac\{r\_ \{H\} \-1–1–1\} \{42–1–1–1\} \\times\\frac\{r\_ \{H\} \-1–1–1–1\} \{42–1–1–1–1\} \\times\\frac\{r\_ \{H\} \-1–1–1–1–1\} \{42–1–1–1–1–1\} \\times1\\end\{eqnarray\* \}

Recall “\(the number of possible sequences 6 H’s”\) was found in step1, and was equal to 1 in the case of 6H’s \(i\.e\. 5H’s and the fixed last one\) \. Note the “minus 1's” represent each “flip” as there is no replacement on flipping each card\.

We can tidy this up by using the notation P\(r,n\):=\\frac\{r\! \} \{ \(r\-n\) \! \} \(also known as the [permutation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation){:target="_blank"} \) so that:

\\mbox\{prob\} \( \{HHHHHH\} \)=\\frac\{r\_H\} \{42\} \\times\\frac\{ \\frac\{r\_H\! \} \{ \(r\_H\-n\_H\) \! \} \} \{ \\frac\{42\! \} \{ \(42\-n\_H\) \! \} \}=\\frac\{P\(r\_H,n\_H\) \} \{P\(42,n\_H\) \}

Now letting:
- r\_C, r\_D, r\_S denote the **number of** **remaining** C, D and S cards, respectively\.
- n\_C, n\_D, n\_S, denote the **number of** **flipped** C, D and S, respectively\.
- n\_ \{Flip\}:=n\_H\+n\_C\+n\_D\+n\_S=\\mbox\{“Total number of cards flipped”\} \):


and following logic as above for computing the probability of the combination \{HHHHHH\}, we see that the probability for observing any combination of cards is:

\\frac\{P\(r\_H,n\_H\) \\times P\(r\_C,n\_C\) \\times P\(r\_D,n\_D\) \\times P\(r\_S,n\_S\) \} \{P\(42,n\_ \{Flip\} \) \} \\times\( \\mbox\{the number of possible sequences of n\_H H’s, n\_C C’S, n\_D D’s, n\_S S’s\} \)

where the last term was computed in step 1\. \(This formula is similar to the probability mass function of a [binomial random variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution#Probability_mass_function){:target="_blank"} \. \)

**Step3: Summing these individual probabilities to establish the overall probability for the horse winning, and conversion to odds**

Since each combination of cards is independent of another, we can sum the probabilities of all winning combinations for each suit to obtain the overall probability of each horse winning\.

We can now use these probabilities and the following formula to convert them to odds \(of the form numerator:denominator “against”; i\.e\. we expect the horse will lose numerator times for every denominator times it wins\):

odds=\\frac\{1\-prob\} \{prob\}

**Code:**

Here is some python code that follows this solution \(and hence has not be optimised by e\.g\. vectorising loops\) \. The functions:
- `choose` computes our equation \{n\\choose r\}:=\\frac\{n\! \} \{n\! \(n\-r\) \! \} \(also known as the [combination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination){:target="_blank"} \)
- `perm` computes the permutation equation P\(r,n\):=\\frac\{r\! \} \{ \(r\-n\) \! \}
- `prob_win` computes the probability of horse X in the set \{H,C,D,S\} winning\.
